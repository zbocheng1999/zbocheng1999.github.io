Some comments about teaching undergraduate-level economics courses

    This course serves as an introduction to the principles of microeconomics, used to understand the behaviors of individuals anf firms operating in markets and in other strategic interactions. Topics covered include opportunity cost, scarcity, preferences and decision making, gains from trade, institutions, efficiency, firms, market power, competition, supply and demand, market failure, and more.

* Intermediate Microeconomics *(Autumn 2023, Spring 2023)*

    This course builds on the fundamental concepts and techniques from introductory-level microeconomics. At the intermediate level, however, we will engage in a more mathematically rigorous treatment of microeconomics to sharpen our theoretical understanding of economics. Constraint optimization is an essential tool for much of economic analysis and, in many circumstances, may be solved using Lagrangian multipliers. Materials in the course are essential for tackling upper level economics such as financial economics, game theory, labor economics, development economics, and industrial organization. Furthermore, it forms the basis of modern macroeconomics.
